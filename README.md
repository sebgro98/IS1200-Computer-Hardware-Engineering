# IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering
 
Course contents
The course gives basic knowledge of how a computer functions and is built-up both from a hardware and from a software perspective The course is divided into six different modules, which for example include the following basic concepts:

C-programming and assembler language: pointers, functions, stack, assembly language, machine language, instruction encoding and processor registers.
I/O system: timers, interrupts and memory mapped I/O.
Digital design: truth tables, gates, boolean algebra, multiplexers, decoders, adders, combinatorial nets, sequential networks and registers.
Processor construction: arithmetic-logic unit, data path, control unit and pipeline.
Memory architectures: instruction cache, data cache and virtual memory.
Parallel processors and programs: Amdahl's law, different variants of parallelism as well as multicore.
Note that module 3 is recommended prior knowledge to the course and comes not to be treated on lectures or labs. However, the material for module 3 will be available on the course homepage, as it is prior knowledge to module 4.

Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, the student shall be able to

Implement low-level programs in the C programming language and in an assembly language
Implement low-level programs with input-output, timers, and interrupts
Analyse processor microarchitectures, with and without a pipeline,
Analyse memory hierarchies, including cache-structures.
Compare fundamental concepts about multiprocessor computers.
Explain and describe technical solutions both orally and in writing. 
For higher grades, the student shall also be able to construct more complex programs and/or discuss and analyze concepts within the course. The details are specified in the course memo.
